Sure, here's the source code for a binary search algorithm in Python without comments and with no other extras:

```python
def binary_search(array, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(array) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if array[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif array[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
            
    return -1
```
