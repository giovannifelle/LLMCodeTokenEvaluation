```python
def is_palindrome(string):   # Defining the algorithm's header (function name) with its return type and parameters string in parentheses after it followed by a colon : . Python uses indentation to define scope, so we use colons not brackets. 
    length = 0              # Initialize variable `length` of data type integer which will be used for storing the number of characters present inside our inputted parameter string such as "racecar". This is necessary because it can't determine if a sentence or phrase are palindrome, only words with an equal amount at start and end.
    while True:              # Starts looping to calculate length ‘length’ . It will continue until we get the value of 'string'. If string not given as input then automatically it considers empty space also in count (which is always zero). The keyword `while` loops through a block of code only if condition matches.
        try:                  # Try-catch blocks are used to handle exceptions . In Python, any variable which doesn’t have value or memory will be considered as 'None'. ‘try' bloc includes the codes that may raise exception and then is handled by catch块 in case of an error during execution block.
            string[length]     # Accessing each character present at specific index from end (string) to start(first access). As we are looking for palindromic strings, first occurrence should be same as last one on both ends and continue this till the middle part is checked ie length/2 times.
        except IndexError:    # If not enough characters exist in string then raise a `Index error` . This exception will catch if any other operation fail due to lack of elements present at certain indices, raising an 'out-of range' message for our case – this is how we know when the loop has finished.
            break              # Breaks out from infinite while true which makes it a palindrome checker and stops further execution once string length reaches midway point (length/2).
        length += 1           # Incrementing `length` by one after every iteration to move towards middle of the word or phrase. ‘+=’ is an operator in python that adds integer(s) on left hand side operand with a variable at right and assign it back into Left Hand Operand (here our length).
    return True              # Returns `True` once finished looping through all characters, indicating the string/word to be checked was indeed palindromic. Thus algorithm will end here without going further beyond this point if no non-match found after checking only half of it with break condition met at middle which means we have a Palindrome in python (no exception raised).
