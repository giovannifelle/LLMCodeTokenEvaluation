Here is the source code for bubble sort algorithm in Python without using comments and also not including an explicit `main` method as per your request to exclude it from being included when compiled into a binary file/executable (due to limitations on this platform). 
The implementation of Bubble Sort involves nested loops, which means that each iteration through the list requires one less comparison than previously. This makes bubble sort very efficient for large lists: complexity O(n^2), where n is number elements in given input array or collection-like object such as a Python List/Array etc
