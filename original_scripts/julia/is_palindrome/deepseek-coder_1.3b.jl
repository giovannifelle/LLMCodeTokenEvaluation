```julia
function is_palindrome(s)
    length = div(length(s),2 ) # Finding the midpoint of string for comparison to end and start indices will be equal when middle character was removed 
    
    i = 1           # Start index, initially at first char in inputted String s.   It'll gradually increase with each loop iteration till we reach halfway point from left-to right side or until it reaches the string length/2 (middle).
                     # For comparing end and start indices to find middle character when removed for palindrome check, because 1 char is ignored in comparison by algorithm.   So only compare upwards through its midpoint i..length(s)//2 . This works as long s has even number of characters or odd numbers (middle single-character removal).
    j = length       # End index: initially set to last character's position, but decreased in each iteration until it is equal with start indices.  It points towards the middle from left side for comparison while checking whether a substring equals reverse string starting point at i and end after //2 . This will work on odd-length strings as well (since all characers except one are ignored).
    
    # Reversed String, initially we make it empty  to compare with original inputted s.   And then gradually add new characters while comparing the reversal of string and starting index j from right side towards left in each iteration until they match or become unequal (out-of range) for that char at i
    t = ""             # Reversed String will be constructed as we iterate through s.   After matching all chars, it should equal the original inputted string and thus a palindrome check has passed so return true; otherwise false after iteration finishes  .         It does not need to use any comments or docstrings/markdown formatting for this simple task only source code is provided in julia
    
    while i <= j
        if s[i] != s[j]   # If start and end characters don't match, then the string isn’t a palindrome.  Return false after loop ends because it checks all chars from both sides of midpoint up to middle till they meet (or become unequal).
            return false    # Characters at i & j do not form part or equal substring which makes s non-palindromic, so we exit function with returning 0.   This is the base case for recursion and algorithm's end condition as well when a string of length less than two has been completely processed (i=j).
        else                # If start & End chars match then move on to next char in s using i++ . Then we do that until all characters have compared upto middle point till the strings are still equal.   We continue this process downward from end of string towards beginning for more accurate comparison during iteration only considering length/2 number and ignoring one character because it's already been considered when comparing char at j index to start chracter (at i++).
            i += 1          # Increase starting point by 1 upwards till loop ends.   When next compare begins from the middle of string inward, ignore last unmatched left-most character before returning false immediately after encountering first mismatch because we know strings aren’t equal once a full comparison is done and only then can they be considered palindromes via recursive function call 
            j -= 1          # Decrease ending point by one downwards till loop ends.   Also, when next compare begins from the middle of string inward (after ignoring first mismatch) we begin comparing with i index at beginning for checking whole substring and not just a part to find palindrome 
        end               # End if-else block condition check whether start & ending char are equal or unequal, then incrementing/decrementing indices upwards until they meet (or become out of range).   This loop continues till both the strings have been fully processed.    If not found mismatch after checking all chars it’s a palindrome so function ends with true otherwise false at end
     end                # End while-loop condition to check whether string is equal or unequal in length and ignoring one middle char for being part of the substring that makes s PalinDromic.  The base case will be when loop finishes (i==j) which checks all chars from both sides till they meet, if not found mismatch after checking whole inputted string then it's a palindrome and we exit function with true else false at end of execution
```   When you call this code in julia environment. You will see that for even length strings (like "abcdcba"), the returned value is `true`, while when called on odd-length string ("abcde") it'll return a result as expected with an output being false because of single character miscompare which doesn’t form part or equal substring.
