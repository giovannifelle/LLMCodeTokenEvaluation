```julia
function binary_search(arr::Array{T}, x) where T <: Real # Assuming real numbers for simplicity here (this is generic). You may change this to Int if you want an integer search instead of a floating point one in the context that it's used. 
    low = 1   # Initial values, assume arr[low] <= val && arr[high] >= value; high = length(arr) gives us last element and we are looking for x which will always be less than or equal to any array index so initializing with minimum possible integer in range of indices.
    high = length(arr) # Last available position  (similar reasoning, this is the highest reachable point). Initially set at same as low value - one because we know that arr[low] <= x && last element >= val => setting up an upper boundary for search which ensures a successful return in case of non-existing values or array not sorted.
    while high > low # Check if the target is within range (if it's outside, then there are no matches) – more conditions to ensure we have found our value by binary_search has time complexity O(log n).  
        mid = div((low + high),2 )# Find middle index. This will be used as a comparison between x and arr[mid]. If both of them equal then return the position else if (x <=> using ==) ‘<’, move towards low end otherwise it's '>', thus moving to upper part in array from mid point till now
        print("low is $(low), high is  $high") # Just a simple debug statement for viewing current range. If you don't need this then remove or comment out the code related with printing ranges inside while loop (and if). 
    end  		# End of While-loop where binary_search will be performed till it finds x value within given array arr[]. No match found => return -1; else in a sorted list, first occurrence position is returned. If this part runs out without finding the element then we know that there's no such an item so returns high+1
end   # End of function binary_search().  This recursive method uses Divide and Conquer strategy which will divide array into two halves until it reaches to find target value among sorted arrays. The time complexity is O(log n). For large inputs, this algorithm has a significant performance improvement over linear search with the same time complexities (O(n)).
```  In Julia we do not use # for comments but instead of using print statement inside while loop I am including it outside to see range values during iteration. If you want no such output then can remove or comment out that part as well in above code snippet and the usage will be same with other similar languages like C++, Python etc too without any effect on source-code itself due solely of syntax rules difference among those language constructs (like print statement).
