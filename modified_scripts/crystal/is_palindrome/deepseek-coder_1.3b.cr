This program checks if a string provided by user inputted parameter `is palinrom` or no when the entered text into any form of field is identical forwards and backwards (i.e., it's actually "a word", an expression within itself).  The function will return true in such case, otherwise false at the end indicating that given string isnâ€™t a Palindrome - which means readable or writable forward from start to finish without any changes detected .
