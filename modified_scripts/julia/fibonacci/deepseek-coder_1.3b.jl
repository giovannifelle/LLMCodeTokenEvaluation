function fibonacci()
    a, b = 0, 1 
    while true             // loop forever until explicitly stopped using an appropriate break statement  (either explicit, via return in function call , manual termination etc)   . In julia main thread does not end by default. It waits for us to kill it ourselves or handle interruptions like KeyboardInterrupt(s). However the user can stop and restart their script manually if they want
        println(a) // prints current fib number (next in sequence), but no newline, since this is a printing only line of code not part of Fibonacci series.    . So it will be printed over several times as long the loop continues running on an infinite basis until manually stopped by user
        a, b = b, a + b  // next two values in sequence are calculated from current one and previous ones (a & b now become 'b' new value of Fibonacci series) . Then it will print with no extra space after each line.     To ensure that only first n numbers get printed we use `n` as loop counter until a limit has been reached, e.g., fib(10).
    end             // ends while-loop here (end of sequence), equivalent to the break statement in Python/C++ which can be used for controlling loops and stopping functions at any point based on conditional logic if required  or using return when we are done with a particular operation, etc.   . The loop will continue until our user manually stops it by an interruption like KeyboardInterrupt(s).
end             // ends the main function in Julia so that this is treated as program entrypoint and all future code after here cannot be run without calling `fibonacci()` again or using recursive calls.  (We only have print statement inside fibincci()) . Note: The above two statements are not valid syntax because they contain comments, which would cause them to generate errors in Julia unless we remove the semicolons and spaces around each line of code below if it's a block-like construct that runs multiple lines at once.
