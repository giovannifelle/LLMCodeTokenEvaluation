         val y = xs length  in a variable named 'y'.   then print it out on console (println("Final Sorted Array is : " + res)) 
         }  0  call to recursion end here, and then start processing it on console .     for example: if you're array is [5 ,4 ,3,6] the result will be :[ ] where each element represents a step of merge sort process.
