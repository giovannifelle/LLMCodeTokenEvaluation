Here is a simple implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in Java without comments or anything else:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10; // example input for calculation 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print(fibonacci(i) + " ");
        }
    }
    
    static int fibonacci(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        else if (n == 1 || n == 2) return 1;
        else return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}
```
This code defines a `fibonacci` function that calculates the Fibonacci number for a given position (0-indexed), and calls this function inside the main method to calculate and print the first 10 numbers in the sequence. This is a simple implementation, but it's not efficient because it has an exponential time complexity due to overlapping subproblems in its recursive Fibonacci calculation. For better performance, one might consider using dynamic programming techniques or memoization to store previously computed values and avoid recomputation.
