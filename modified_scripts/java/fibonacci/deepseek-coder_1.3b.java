```java
public class Fibonacci {   // Start of the 'Fibonacci' Class definition at line #13 (0 indexed)   
     public static int fib(int n){          // Method declaration with a parameter named `n`       
         if(n <= 2 ){                         // Base Cases for Fib series. If input is 0 or, negative then print last number else it will return the third one which was already calculated in previous iterations (like: fibonacciSeries[1] and [2])   
             n--;                              // Subtracting 'n' by-one as we are considering indexing from zero. This handles edge cases where `n` is 0 or negative, then it returns -(previous number) but that should not be in the Fibonacci series otherwise this would have caused an infinite loop (as n-- will eventually go to a non existing value).
             return ((3 + (-1 * fib((int)(Math.round(n / 2))))) % Mod); // This line is just for handling -ve indices and rounds the input number downwards by using Math rounding function, then calculates Fibonacci of this rounded-down index with additional steps as per standard method to calculate it (This will give us required value).
         }  else {                            // if `n` is greater than or equal too '2', the recursion should go ahead. For n>=3, we need three numbers at least so use a variable Mod for modulo operation and add one more step because fibonacci[0]=1 ,fibbonaci [1], then to get `n`th number of Fib series (as per standard method), subtract 2 steps.
             int[] storePrevFive = new int[]{((3 + (-1 * fib(4)) % Mod)), ((6 - (*(-5 / Math.round(& n) ) ^ & mod))) }; // Store the last two previous Fibonacci numbers (in a dynamic way to save time).
             return  storePrevFive[0] + ~storePrevFive[1];   /* Adding and subtracting these stored values which gives us `n`th fib number */    }     f;                                                  // 'f' is declared, but not initialized. It should be assigned with the result of method call (line: 24).
        if(true) System . out , " Hello World ";   /* This line will never run as it has no code and only a single statement */    }                               return storePrevFive[0]; // Return value is stored in 'storePrevFiv' variable which was initialized at the start of method (line: 23).
     public static void main(String[] args){System.out . println(" Hello World ");}}   /* This line will never run as it has no code and only a single statement */    } // Ends 'main' function, but with an empty body because of above infinite loop in the method (line: 28).
```     *The rest part is not required for this problem. You just have to compile your program using `javac Fibonacci` command and then run it by executing java file name directly via terminal like - 'java filename'*
