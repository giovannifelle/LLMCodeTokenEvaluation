If you add more arguments later on in order change them. The main functionality of this script is as follows: It will locate an element from a sorted list using Binary Search Algorithm
    left = 0   # Define the starting index to be zero at first (this starts with being located within our array) [left, right] are indexes where binary search can occur - we start by assuming that all numbers in arr[] fall into this range. After every comparison during a call of Binary Search Algorithm it shifts its left and/or upper boundary accordingly
    #right = length(arrangeebleList)-1  You should remove the last line (line with right index) as binary_search will always start at zero if your list is sorted in ascending order. Also, you can use this to find out how many times a number appears in array by reducing it towards finding first occurrence after every comparison
    while(left <= right){  # Begin the main loop for Binary Search Algorithm (we repeat until left and/or right index crosses each other) [starts with both being zero; then we compare, move our bounding box]   We use "<=" instead of just ";", because if you put a number at 'right', it will get missed out.
        mid = (left + right)/2  # Calculate the index to be used for comparing and moving around in array [mid is where we would look each time during an iteration]   Use integer division "//" instead of normal "/", because when computing left or upper, use int-based type so that if there are decimal points they do not affect our final results
