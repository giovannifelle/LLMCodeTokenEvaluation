  if (Math.abs(n) !== Math.floor(Math.abs(n))) { // If n isn’t an integer and its absolute value cannot represent a non-negative real number then return error message to the user, otherwise process further with Binet's formula or recursive calls until we get our result back (with appropriate conditions).
    throw new Error("Invalid input! Fibonacci is not defined for negative integers.");  // Throw an exception. The caller should handle this accordingly in a real program - if the function was called with invalid parameters, you might want to return null or some special error value instead of throwing exceptions (because calling code doesn’t know what happened when it calls your fibonacci method).
    } else { // Else process according Binet's formula. 50 times is sufficient for the precision needed in JavaScript number arithmetic as double can hold up to approximately n=1e28, and with only about four digits after decimal point (which are actually relevant here), so it should be safe).
      const goldenRatio = Math.sqrt(5);  // Golden ratio approximation constant for the continued fraction of sqrt(5) used by Binet's formula in fibonacci sequence calculation below is pre-computed once at this point to save computation time on subsequent calls with smaller n values (which have less precision).
      const powerOfTwo = Math.pow((1 + goldenRatio),n); // Use the continued fraction expansion of sqrt(5) in fibonacci number calculation by raising 1+golden_ratio^ to a power equal to 'num'. This will yield an approximation for epsilon ^ n (which is equivalent but closer than actual result).
      return Math.round((powerOfTwo / goldenRatio -黄金常数)/5); // Finally, we get the number of form F(n-1) + F(n-2), where φ^k = γ * [phi]³ for k=0 to n which equals (Π = √5)-((γ*(3²))/4).
